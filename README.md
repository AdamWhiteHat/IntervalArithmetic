# IntervalArithmetic

From [Wikipedia's article on Interval Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic):
> Instead of representing a value as a single number, interval arithmetic represents each value as a range of possibilities.
> Using interval arithmetic, [...] one works with an interval [a,b] that defines the range of values that x can have. In other words, any value of the variable x lies in the closed interval between a and b.
> A function f, when applied to x, [...] produces an interval [a,b] which includes all the possible values for f(x) for all x âˆˆ [a,b].
